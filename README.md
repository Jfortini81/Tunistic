## Motivation
Music creates a feeling of self-expression and relatability that is universally understood and this shared experience is what Tunistic aims to capture and celebrate through discovering new music.

While there are already multiple music streaming apps, Tunistic offers a unique approach with its focus on simplicity. 

Instead of using multiple, complex algorithms with unknown variables to generate recommendations, Tunistic bases its suggestions on a single song that the user knows and likes. This provides a more transparent and predictable music discovery experience.

## Features
- Recommends similar tracks to the ones that the user types in using Spotify Web API.

- Listen to a preview of the track by tapping on it.

- Save the track to a favorites list by hearting it.
